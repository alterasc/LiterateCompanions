# Literary Companions - mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Converts books that grant permanent bonuses to main character into single use usable items that can be used by any member of the party.

Original book text can be seen if you open detailed item info, it's in flavor text.

Lexicon and one devil specific book are untouched for obvious reasons.

If installing mid-playthrough there are couple of UI things to note:   
- If before installing this mod you have already read the book that was converted, then it will look in the inventory with red outline as if it can't be used, but that's just UI thing.   
- If you're also using Toybox rarity tags, you will need to temporarily disable tagging, use those old books, and then you can enable rarity tags back. This is only for old books, those that you haven't encountered yet will look normally

Doesn't seem to introduce save dependency.

Installation: as any other UMM mod
