# Literary Companions - mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Converts books that grant permanent bonuses to main character into single use usable items that can be used by any member of the party.

Original book text can be seen if you open detailed item info, it's in flavor text.

Lexicon and one devil specific book are untouched for obvious reasons.

Can be installed mid playthrough. If before installing this mod you have already read the book that was converted, then it will look in the inventory as if it can't be used, but that's just UI thing.

Doesn't seem to introduce save dependency.

Installation: as any other UMM mod
